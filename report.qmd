### Overview
One-page, reproducible WDI snapshot for 2022 using simple EDA and plots.
Data are sourced from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators [@worldbank-wdi].  
This report is generated with Quarto to ensure reproducibility [@quarto-docs].

### Data Loading
Read the provided CSV and quickly inspect the first rows.
```{python}
# Load the dataset
import pandas as pd

wdi = pd.read_csv("wdi.csv")

# Display the first few rows
wdi.head()
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Structure, summary stats, and missingness check for basic data health.
```{python}
#| echo: true              
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
wdi.info()
wdi.describe()
wdi.isna().sum()
```

### Summary of Findings from EDA

- The dataset contains **217 observations** across **14 indicators** for various countries in 2022.  
- Some indicators, such as *Adult Literacy Rate* and *Life Expectancy*, have many missing values, while variables like *GDP per Capita* and *Inflation Rate* are more complete.  
- The numerical summary shows large variation in GDP per capita and unemployment rates, suggesting strong economic diversity across countries.  
- We will focus our visual analysis on three indicators: **GDP per capita**, **Life Expectancy**, and **Unemployment Rate**, as they reflect key aspects of economic well-being, health, and labor outcomes.

### GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy
```{python}
#| label: fig-gdp-life
#| fig-cap: "GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy (2022). Source: World Bank WDI (2022)."
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.scatter(wdi["gdp_per_capita"], wdi["life_expectancy"])
plt.title("GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy (2022)")
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (current US$)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy (years)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

- Clear positive, *diminishing-returns* pattern: big life-expectancy gains at lower incomes that taper off as GDP per capita rises.
- A few outliers deviate from the curve, but overall the association is tight—suggesting income is a strong correlate of longevity in 2022.


### Top 10 Countries by Unemployment Rate
```{python}
#| label: fig-unemp
#| fig-cap: "Top 10 Countries by Unemployment Rate (2022). Source: World Bank WDI (2022)."
top10_unemp = wdi.nlargest(10, "unemployment_rate")
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.bar(top10_unemp["country"], top10_unemp["unemployment_rate"])
plt.title("Top 10 Countries by Unemployment Rate (2022)")
plt.xlabel("Country")
plt.ylabel("Unemployment Rate (%)")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

- Unemployment is highly concentrated in a small set of countries (≈20–38%), indicating substantial labor-market stress at the top of the distribution.
- Country rankings highlight regional and structural differences; policy context matters when comparing rates across economies.

### Key Statistics Table
```{python}
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics for key 2022 indicators — GDP per capita, life expectancy, unemployment rate. Source: World Bank WDI (2022)."
key_indicators = ["gdp_per_capita", "life_expectancy", "unemployment_rate"]
summary_table = wdi[key_indicators].describe().T[["mean","min","max"]].round(2)
summary_table
```


### Discussion & Cross-References
As shown in **@fig-gdp-life**, countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have longer life expectancy, reflecting the positive relationship between income and health outcomes.  

Meanwhile, **@fig-unemp** displays the ten countries with the highest unemployment rates in 2022, revealing wide differences in labor market conditions.  

Finally, **@tbl-summary** summarizes the main indicators used in this analysis.
